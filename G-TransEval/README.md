# G-TransEval
Here lists the benchmark data and experiment results of different models on our benchmark.

## Benchmark
G-TransEval is the first categorized test set designed to provide fine-grained and extensive evaluations of code translation models. It comprises a total of 400 code translation pairs between 5 language, i.e., Python, C++, Java, C#, and JavaScript. Each test sample are augmented with unit test cases.

- Type 1: 125 pairs. Located in `./Type1`

- Type 2: 125 pairs. Located in `./Type2`

- Type 3: 125 pairs. Located in `./Type3`

- Type 4: &nbsp; 25 pairs. Located in `./Type4`

## Results
[./Results](Results/README.md) lists the translation results and evaluation results of different models on our benchmark.
